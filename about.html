                Sea otters, also known as Enhydra lutris, are carnivorus mammals that live on the along the coasts of the Pacific Ocean in North America and Asia. Sea otters have webbed feet, water-repellent fur to keep them dry and warm, and nostrils and ears that close in the water. They are often seen floating on their backs on the surface of waters. They can be seen tangeling themselves in seaweed so they don't drift away in their sleep.

            <p>
                Sea otters are considered endangered becuase fur traders hunted them for their thick and luxurious pelts in the late 1800s. By 1900, sea otters were nearly extinct with less than 2,000 remaining. The international Fur Seal Treaty of 1911 stopped further exploitation of sea otters. On top of that, so did the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act. Today, their numbers are increasing, but are not close to previous numbers. They are still considered endangered to this day.

            <p>
                Sea Otter give birth in the water. A sea otter mother carries her pup on her belly and spends a great deal of time grooming it for the first three months. When she dives for food, the mother often wraps her pup in strands of kelp to keep it from drifting, kind of like when they sleep. If she senses danger, she grabs the pup by the loose skin of the neck with her teeth and dives until they reach safety.
